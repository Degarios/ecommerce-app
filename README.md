### E-commerce App: Your Mobile Shopping Experience, Redefined

Welcome to the **E-commerce App**, a comprehensive mobile shopping platform ( using Pribet Shopping Mart as a use-case ) built with the powerful trio of **React Native**, **Expo**, and **Firebase**. Designed to offer a smooth and secure shopping experience, this app integrates robust authentication features, a dynamic admin section, and all the functionalities you expect from a modern e-commerce application.

**Key Features:**

- **React Native & Expo**: Ensuring a seamless, cross-platform user experience with efficient performance and responsiveness.
- **Firebase Integration**: Secure user authentication, real-time database management, and cloud storage to keep your appâ€™s data synchronized and safe.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated section for administrators to manage the app's database, track user activity, and gain valuable insights through a detailed dashboard overview.
- **Shopping Cart**: A user-friendly cart feature where orders are stored, reviewed, and managed before checkout.
- **Complete E-commerce Functionality**: From browsing products to managing orders, this app covers all the bases to create a fully functional e-commerce experience.

With the **E-commerce App**, you're not just building a shopping platform; you're crafting a comprehensive digital marketplace that can scale and adapt to your needs. Whether you're diving into mobile development, exploring Firebase, or looking to create your own e-commerce solution, this project is a solid foundation for innovation.

**P.S**: To access the Admin **floating action button** that only appears to **ADMINS** in the *Home Screen** of the app, change the email in the **setIsAdmin** function to your desired email in the **HomeScreen.js** file
